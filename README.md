The Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm (or the method of prime implicants) is a method used for minimization of boolean functions that was developed by W.V. Quine and extended by Edward J. McCluskey.[1][2][3] It is functionally identical to Karnaugh mapping, but the tabular form makes it more efficient for use in computer algorithms, and it also gives a deterministic way to check that the minimal form of a Boolean function has been reached. It is sometimes referred to as the tabulation method.
